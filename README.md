5. Application Structure: Understand the structure of the React application, including components, props, and state management.


## Discussion and Reflections

This project required us to code along with a Scrimba lesson building a meme generator app. The was not a lot of challenges because we were just following along and didn't have to actually think about certain things. The concepts deiscussed in the Scrimba lesson are very crucial to getting stated and well acquinted with React. React seems to be a very interesting way to build web appliactions but the are certain concepts that need more further attention to detail. Concepts like useEffect and useState are the core functionality of React and I need to make sure that I understand them very well and I'm able to implement them correctly. React has syntax that is a mixture of Vanilla JavaScript and HTML which would require alot of practice to get used to all the nuances.
